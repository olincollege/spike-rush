## Overview

### Project Goals

Our goal for this project was to implement a working version of the Spike Rush game mode from Valorant. We focused on making a top down version and utilized the pygame module during development. We wanted to ensure the game was highly interactive and fun to play with others.

### Game Overview

Spike Rush is a top down shooter. Before the game begins, players will be able to choose from a selection of guns to use during the game. Players will spawn in designated attack (blue) and defense (red) zones. The attacking player is given a spike, and must plant and detonate it in the spike zone (yellow). The defending player must protect the zone or defuse the spike if it has been planted. The game ends if either player is eliminated or a spike objective is achieved.
